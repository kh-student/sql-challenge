# sql-challenge

### Background
#### It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

#### For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

### Data Steps and Objectives:
```
1. Data Modeling
2. Data Engineering
3. Data Analysis
```

### Navigating the Repository:
#### Project files can be found in the ```EmployeeSQL``` folder. Files should be viewed in the following order, which corresponds with the three steps indicated above.
